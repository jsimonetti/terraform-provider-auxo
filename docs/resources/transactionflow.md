# auxo_transactionflow (Resource)

A transactionflow resource represents the defined incoming and outgoing flows on a protect surface.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "auxo_transactionflow" "tf_ps_ad" {
  protectsurface                 = auxo_protectsurface.ps_ad.id
  incoming_protectsurfaces_allow = [auxo_protectsurface.ps_mail.id]
  incoming_protectsurfaces_block = [auxo_protectsurface.ps_guests.id]
  outgoing_protectsurfaces_allow = [auxo_protectsurface.ps_mail.id]
  outgoing_protectsurfaces_block = [auxo_protectsurface.ps_guests.id]
}
```

**Important** if a flow is allowed on protect surface A to go to protect surface B, it does not mean that the flow is accepted on protect surface B. There needs to be mutual consensus, which means two resources of transactionflow are needed, one for each protect surface, see example below.

```terraform
resource "auxo_transactionflow" "tf_ps_a" {
  protectsurface                 = auxo_protectsurface.ps_a.id
  outgoing_protectsurfaces_allow = [auxo_protectsurface.ps_b.id]
}

resource "auxo_transactionflow" "tf_ps_b" {
  protectsurface                 = auxo_protectsurface.ps_b.id
  incoming_protectsurfaces_allow = [auxo_protectsurface.ps_a.id]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `protectsurface` (String) The ID of the protectsurface

### Optional

- `incoming_protectsurfaces_allow` (Set of String) The IDs of the protectsurface that are allowed to send traffic to this protectsurface
- `incoming_protectsurfaces_block` (Set of String) The IDs of the protectsurface that are blocked to send traffic to this protectsurface
- `outgoing_protectsurfaces_allow` (Set of String) The IDs of the protectsurface that are allowed to send traffic to from this protectsurface
- `outgoing_protectsurfaces_block` (Set of String) The IDs of the protectsurface that are blocked to send traffic to from this protectsurface
